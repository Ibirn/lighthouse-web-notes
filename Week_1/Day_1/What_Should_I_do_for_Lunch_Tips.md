### Tips

Experiment with the comparison operators (`>`. `<`, `===`, etc) in node REPL in the terminal. 

Work iteratively! Break it into steps.

To figure out where to use the included variables, log them to the console and see what the output is. Try it with the following code:

```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = (hungry, availableTime) => {
  console.log("hungry?", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is?", availableTime);
}
```
